### Project Description:

The project invites viewers to experience what it is like to live on campus during this time of COVID-19. This is presented in a creative music video that replicates 'A day in my life' of myself who are currently on campus, mainly through sound. The music video is created in 2020 Fall semester, in the midst of global pandamic, where a lot of students are hoping to come back to the campus but are restricted from travelling for many different reasons. Therefore, the idea behind this project was to provide a platform for returning students (who couldn't return to go back to the times when they were on campus) and for Freshmen students (who never had a chance to live on campus)to have an indirect experience of life on campus. Without strictly adhering to the realism, the music video hoped to grasp a sense of what a typical life would be like on campus. By adding a daily routines like brushing teeth, going to gym, eating at D2, we wanted to convey how relatively normal the day to day life is on campus, but of course, with some new "norms" and adjustments. By sharing new "norms", through aounds, such as daily symptom checks and thermometer screenings, apart from providing a nostalgic experience, we also wanted to inform them with new health guidelines and protocols that all students need to make adjustments on. Such information will help students to make betters decisions for their next semester and help them to be mentally be prepared for what to expect on campus if they choose to return. 


The story is about two friends talking about a life in NYUAD during COVID times, where one tells a day of her life to another friend. This narrative consists of two parts; the dialogue between the two students recorded as a conversation, and the flashback part that is sound-designed as a musical piece by layering sound of . Although it is a sound project, where sounds leads the image, image plays a prominent part in this sound project. It visually supports viewers to move space and time.  

The music video is located in a website dedeicated for the music video. Website consists of three pages in total; main hompage, music video page, and learn more page. The landing page briefly introduces the project, intentions, and target audience. It also provides a link to visit NYUAD website to learn more about the school and most-updated guidelines. The second page, music video page essentially allows viewers to listen and watch music video. We refrained ourselves from adding any text to minimize disraction from viewers to focus on the sound. Finally the Learn more page consists of numbers of highly requested questions that viewers might be wondering about in regards to the life on campus.  

### Process:

The project started with an intention of wanting to share what it is like to live on campus during the time of COVID. How we would creatively achieve this were then discussed with ideas such as recording ASMR, interviewing students pitched. Through brainstormeing, we decided to record sounds that we encounter in daily life and creatively mix and sound deisgn them to make a musical piece. Highlighting the essence of sound that evokes a strong emotion and effectively captures the sense of place, we challenged ourself to refrain ourselves from linguistically explaining what it is like to live on campus.

I then started to walk around campus and collecting rhythmic sounds that I encounter in my daily life that can be used as a part of the music. Simple sounds such as gate opening sounds or thermometer clicking sounds are easily overlooked but when given close a attention, they collaborately creates a sense of place and captures the essence of NYUAD. Sounds were recorded on Iphone voice memo application. Although it would have been ideal to use microphone to capture the sound, since we didn't have a device, we recorded sound and video separatly to maximize the quality of sound. Once I have collected all the sounds, Rashid and I started recording foley sounds and dialogue. Before we start recording dialogue, we collected a room tone sound with an AC on. Then, we unplugged all the electronic devices and turned off the AC to minimize the background noise. Foley sounds such as cleaning up bottles, opening wardrobes were recorded individually, then it was later at the editing stage where all these individual sounds were layered together to harmoniously create an audio mise-en-scene of the scene.

The software called audacity was used for a sound-design. Especially for the flashback rhythmic music section, each collected sounds had to be specially manipulated and edited to fit into the rhythm. Sounds were cross-faded to connect them smoothly and I used a pencil tool to adjust notes. Many effect features were used to manipulate the voice of RA and student that was both recorded by Rashid. 

For videos, I used Davinci Resolve 16 and a video editing application caled VLLO to make supporting visuals for sound. The filmed footages are edited in the way that best captures the emotional aspect of the sound. The images are ideologically and metaphorically understood, rather than representing a strict realism. Several filters were used to differentiate flashback from the dialogue, and numbers of transitions and animaitons were used to elevate and represent the corresponding emotions and happenings of the sound. 

Once we finished the frist draft of the music video, we had a chance to get a feedback from Kristen, professor and peer colleauges. Based on their feedbacks and suggestions, we improved greatly. We revisited the narrative and made adjustments to ensure it was comprehensive and we also got rid of all the cartoonized representation of scenes, instead . The song was also extended and what was originally in the conversation style sounds were edited to fit into the sound to make the flashback transition much more comprehensible. 

For the website, we mainly used hover effects and transition in CSS to add some interactivity. 


### Reflection/Evaluation:

Overall had a lot of fun throughout the process, especially when recording and designing sounds. There were many trial and errors during the process, especially when it comes to decoding and encoding storyline. One thing that I would want to improve on is the website. Although we intentiaonlly wanted the appearance of the website was to remain simple and professional so that it can look like a reliable source of information, and music video itself has a lot of interactivity in it, I want to make website that . In my next project, I wish to

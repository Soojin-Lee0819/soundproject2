### Project Description:

The project invites viewers to experience what it is like to live on campus during this time of COVID-19 through a creative music video that presents 'A day in my life' of myself who are currently on campus. The music video is made in 2020 Fall semester, in the midst of global pandamic, where a lot of students are hoping to come back to the campus but are restricted from travelling for many different reasons. Therefore, the idea behind this project was to create a moment of nostalgic experience for returning students (who couldn't return to go back to the times when they were on campus and for Freshmen students (who never had a chance to live on campus)to have an indirect experience of life on campus. Although it is a fictional story, the music video hoped to grasp a sense of what a typical life would be like on campus. By adding a daily routines like brushing teeth, going to gym, eating at D2, we wanted to convey how relatively normal it feels to live on campus but of course, with some new "norms". By sharing new "norms", such as daily symptom checks and thermometer screenings, apart from providing a nostalgic experience, we wanted to inform them with new health guidelines and protocols all students need to follow. This will help students to make decisions on their next semester  and mentally be prepared for what to expect on campus if they choose to return. 
The music video is located in a website dedeicated for the music video. Website consists of three pages in total; main hompage, music video page and learn more page. The landing page briefly introduces the project, intentions and target audience and provides a link to watch a music video ("Hear Us"), or to visit NYUAD homepage to learn more about the school and current situation. The MUSIC Video page essentially allows viewers to enjoy the music video, and finally the Learn more page consists of numbers of highly requested questions that people might ask in regards to the life on campus.  provoking viewers to   with a mix of conversation and a rhythmic cut of daily sound you hear in NYUAD composed in a music.

### Process:

The project started with an intention of wanting to share what it is like to live on campus during the time of COVID. We generic idea about creating "A Day In My Life" vidoe that went viral on YouTube with an audio twist. Instead of typical A Day In My Life videos that narrate a day visually, in this project, we decided to . Many ideas were pitched in regards to the forms and methods to replicate a day in my life with an audio twist. Ideas such as ASMR, how we would implement this for instances to  During brainstorming, we decided to make a day in my life story with a NYUAD COVID times twist.   Based on this idea, we decided to  Since it was a sound project, we While brainstorming, many ideas were shared for instances having an ASMR Based on this idea, we decided to create a Since both of us were one campus, we wanted to 

We started with writing a narration of a day in mylife. Then I started to walk around the campus recording the sound and accompanying videos using iphone. Sounds and videos are recorded separatly to maximize the quality of sound. Once I have collected all the sounds that I encounter daily living in NYUAD, Rashid and I started recording foley sounds and dialogue. After collecting room tone sound with the AC on, we then unplugged all the electronic devices and turned off the AC to capture the best quality dialogue. Foley sounds such as cleaning up bottles, opening wardrobes were recorded individually then it was later layered during sound-mixing process. 


Although, it is a music song, it required a narrative. So we started writing down the script. When writing script, we wrote in detail with layers of the sound needed for a specific scene, for example, for the scene where two people are talking while tea is boiling,  Then we recorded sounds using iphone 11 Voice memos application. Although it would have been ideal to use microphone to capture the sound, since we didn't have a device, we recorded sound and video separatly to maximize the sound quality. When recor. With all the recorded sound, we 

### Reflection/Evaluation:

I had a lot of fun throughout the process. There were many trial errors when recording since the room had to be controlled. For example, when Rashid and I were recording on . Although there were some doubts about . It was almost the process of deceiving people's mind
